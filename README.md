# jsonWithJavaScript
This is an exercise made during the 1st module of Fullstack Developers from IGTI which is Fundamentals of JavaScript.
Here we use an API in JSON that returns a list with random people.
We can search people by their names (full or just a part of it) and we can check some statistics about the selection we've made, such as amount of males and females, the total of their ages and the avarage age of the people.
